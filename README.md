# SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS driver for LDBC Graphalytics

[![Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/ldbc/ldbc_graphalytics_platforms_graphblas.svg?style=svg)](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ldbc/ldbc_graphalytics_platforms_graphblas)

Platform driver for the [LDBC Graphalytics benchmark](https://graphalytics.org) using [SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS](https://github.com/DrTimothyAldenDavis/GraphBLAS) and [LAGraph](https://github.com/GraphBLAS/LAGraph).

To execute the Graphalytics benchmark on GraphBLAS, follow the steps in the Graphalytics tutorial on [Running Benchmark](https://github.com/ldbc/ldbc_graphalytics/wiki/Manual%3A-Running-Benchmark) with the GraphBLAS-specific instructions listed below.

### Project structure

This project implements the GraphBLAS platform driver for the LDBC Graphalytics benchmark. It consists of the following components:

* The platform driver is written in Java and implements the classes required by the [`ldbc_graphalytics` framework](https://github.com/ldbc/ldbc_graphalytics).
* The algorithms (BFS, PR, etc.) are implemented in C in the [LAGraph library](https://github.com/GraphBLAS/LAGraph) (currently on the `dev` branch).
* The C++ wrapper for LAGraph is defined in the [`src/main/c` directory](https://github.com/ldbc/ldbc_graphalytics_platforms_graphblas/tree/main/src/main/c).
* The Java driver uses shell scripts to run the benchmark, see e.g. the [`execute-job.sh`](https://github.com/ldbc/ldbc_graphalytics_platforms_graphblas/blob/main/bin/sh/execute-job.sh) script that invokes the binary program for a given algorithm.
* The graphs (stored in `.v` and `.e` files) are converted to a vertex relabelling file (`.vtx`) and a matrix stored in Matrix Market format (`.mtx`). The vertex relabelling is a bijective mapping that maps between the sparse UINT64 IDs in the original data to a dense contiguous set of IDs between 1 and |V|. The mapping is implemented in the [`relabel.py` Python script](https://github.com/ldbc/ldbc_graphalytics_platforms_graphblas/blob/main/bin/py/relabel.py) that internally uses [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/).

### Dependencies

On Debian/Fedora-based Linux distributions, you may install the prerequisite packages and dependencies listed below using a singe comman:

```
bin/sh/install-dependencies.sh
```

#### Prerequisite packages

Make sure you have the following software packages installed:

* Apache Maven 3+
* CMake 3.10+
* C++ compiler: GCC, Clang, or ICC
* Python 3.8+
* DuckDB Python package (`duckdb`)

On Linux, you may use the following script to install these dependencies:

```bash
bin/sh/install-prerequisites.sh
```

### SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS and LAGraph libraries

The implementation depends on two C libraries, SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS and LAGraph. We require very recent versions of these libraries, so it is best to compile them from their source code.

1. To install [SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS v7.4.0+](https://github.com/DrTimothyAldenDavis/GraphBLAS), run:

    ```bash
    bin/sh/install-graphblas.sh
    ```

1. To install [LAGraph](https://github.com/GraphBLAS/LAGraph) (`dev` branch), run:

    ```bash
    bin/sh/install-lagraph.sh
    ```

### Building only the C++ wrapper

To only build the C++ wrapper (for quick test builds), run the following script:

```bash
bin/sh/build-wrapper-only.sh
```

### Building the project and running the benchmark

1. To initialize the benchmark package, run:

    ```bash
    scripts/init.sh ${GRAPHS_DIR} ${MATRICES_DIR}
    ```

    where

    * `GRAPHS_DIR` is the directory of the graphs and the validation data. The argument is optional and its default value is `~/graphs`.
    * `MATRICES_DIR` is the directory of the pre-generated matrix files (in Matrix Market format). The argument is optional and its default value is `~/matrices`.

    This script creates a Maven package (`graphalytics-${GRAPHALYTICS_VERSION}-graphblas-${PROJECT_VERSION}.tar.gz`). Then, it decompresses the package, initializes a configuration directory `config` (based on the content of the `config-template` directory) and sets default values of the directories (see above) and the number of threads.

    Note that the project uses the [Build Number Maven plug-in](https://www.mojohaus.org/buildnumber-maven-plugin/) to ensure reproducibility. Hence, builds fail if the local Git repository contains uncommitted changes. To build it regardless (for testing), run it as follows:

    ```bash
    scripts/init-for-testing.sh ${GRAPHS_DIR} ${MATRICES_DIR}
    ```

2. Navigate to the directory created by the `init.sh` script:

    ```bash
    cd graphalytics-*-graphblas-*/
    ```

3. Edit the configuration files (e.g. graphs to be included in the benchmark) in the `config` directory.

    * To conduct benchmark runs, edit the `config/benchmark.properties` file and replace the `include = benchmarks/custom.properties` to select the dataset size you wish to use, e.g. `include = benchmarks/xl.properties`
    * Inspect `config/platform.properties` and check whether the value of `platform.graphblas.num-threads` was set correctly.

4. Run the benchmark with the following command:

    ```bash
    bin/sh/run-benchmark.sh
    ```

### Workflow

The workflow of the GraphBLAS implementation is illustrated in the following figure. Note that the "raw graph files" and the "configuration" are provided by the user, while the rest of the data artifacts (intermediate data sets, outputs, etc.) are created automatically by the framework.

### Benchmark with CUDA

Re-init the benchmark framework:
```
scripts/init-for-testing.sh /cuda-graph-analytics/example-data-sets/graphs /cuda-graph-analytics/example-data-sets/matrices 
```
After you modify the code and want to test it:
```
scripts/update-src-c.sh
```
The previous command only copy paste the CXX code into folder `graphalytics-1.10.0-graphblas-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT` and build it. If you want to directly run the benchmark, you can do:
```
scripts/update-run-src-c.sh
```
